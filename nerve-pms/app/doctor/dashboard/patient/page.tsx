                                        Based on the patient&apos;s history and physical examination, the most likely diagnosis is a primary headache disorder, specifically a migraine without aura. The patient&apos;s symptoms of severe, throbbing headaches located in the frontal region, exacerbated by bright lights and loud noises, are characteristic of migraines. The absence of red flag symptoms such as recent head trauma, fever, or visual disturbances further supports this diagnosis.

                                        Differential diagnoses to consider include tension-type headache, cluster headache, and secondary causes of headache such as sinusitis or hypertension. However, the patient&apos;s clinical presentation is most consistent with a migraine.

                                        Further evaluation and management may include lifestyle modifications, pharmacologic therapy with triptans or other migraine-specific medications, and preventive measures to reduce the frequency and severity of migraine attacks.

                                        The patient will be advised to maintain a headache diary to track the frequency, duration, and triggers of his headaches. Lifestyle modifications will be recommended, including regular sleep patterns, stress management techniques, and dietary changes to identify and avoid potential triggers.
